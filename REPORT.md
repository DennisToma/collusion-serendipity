S25 uses a deliberately enriched fixed-history challenge. Source approvals only select cases; the comparison uses fresh outputs in both arms. Neither fresh arm reproduced any of the four archived adverse approvals used to enrich the challenge. With no adverse baseline in the fresh action-first arm, this pilot cannot demonstrate an output-order correction mechanism. The common extra order instruction and fresh model draws also differ from S19; their effects are not separated here.

<!-- S31 summary start -->
**S31:** paired t95% **[0, 0]**, upper sign-flip **p=1**; all five paired differences zero. Mean worker earnings10 in both arms lie between symmetric integer Nash wages18–20 and joint-profit wage0; this does not establish an agreement. Public wages remain visible in self-only games. No equivalence or zero-effect population claim. [All outcomes and figure](results/s31_summary.md).
<!-- S31 summary end -->

<!-- S28 summary start -->
**S28:** paired t95% **[-0.155, 0.355]**, upper sign-flip **p=0.25000**. Extra role-attached table with shared notes in both arms; repetition/format/detail bundled. No isolated arithmetic mechanism or agreement claim. [All outcomes and figure](results/s28_summary.md).
<!-- S28 summary end -->

<!-- S29 summary start -->
**S29:** paired t95% **[-0.049, 0.699]**, upper sign-flip **p=0.06250**. Shared versus self-only notepads in fixed two-person teams. Delivery and stated readability bundled; public actions visible in both arms; approvals do not verify agreement. [All outcomes and figure](results/s29_summary.md).
<!-- S29 summary end -->

<!-- S27 summary start -->
**S27:** paired t95% **[-0.002, 0.352]**, upper sign-flip **p=0.06250**. Two versus three active employees; pair payoffs and shared notes fixed. Team size bundles outsider interaction, workload and history dimension; approvals do not verify agreement. [All outcomes and figure](results/s27_summary.md).
<!-- S27 summary end -->

Five paired game blocks are the resampling unit unless stated otherwise; intervals are descriptive empirical bootstrap bounds. With n5 they can degenerate, and sign/t intervals may disagree. No multiplicity correction, held-out validation or equivalence claims. Actions, private notes and high rewards alone do not verify an agreement or profitable collusion. The Codex binary/effective CLI configuration was not frozen.

Cournot: three integer-output firms, P=max(0,30−total output), cost6, symmetric static Nash q6. Workplace: synthetic fixed work types and personal bonus incentives; no realistic task production. Identity/wording, uncontrolled model draws and shared-service interference limit transfer. Procurement ties are divisible.

**Earlier caveats:** S01 digits cannot identify coding; S02 echoed own notes; S04 fails its exposure gate; S03/S11 dynamics depend on timing/window phase; S07 is driven by one block; S09 removes incoming information as well as memory; S16 is an operational failure with no effect estimate. S19 adverse JSON actions can contradict explanations; S21's action-aware auditor correctly reads the selected challenge cases. No sibling headline change.

S29 remains ODD because one of five blocks ties;the bootstrap-positive interval alone does not satisfy the registered screen. [Post-outcome transparency appendix](results/s29_action_text.md) lists all adverse decisions and infers no intent.

**Next:** S32 registered: fresh human-labor versus automated-compute identity phrase at identical economics, five paired blocks; no live outcomes yet. S30 remains unrun. No secondary-driven promotion.
